## ðŸ’¡ How to use 
To use this application, simply follow these steps:

## ðŸ”§ Config.json
The entire project relies on the `config.json` file inside of the `src` folder.\
Here is an example with all the required settings:
```json

	"key": "your-github-auth-key",
	"use": 0,
	"mode": "create",
	"webhooks": [
		{
			"url": "api-url",
			"repos": "*",
